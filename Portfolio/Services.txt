As a junior Front-end developer I've worked on personal projects and professional ones with advanced HTML and CSS, adding intermediate JavaScript for interactivity. 
I have experience with taking designs to responsive web designs in HTML, using CSS Preprocessors like Sass and frameworks like Bootstrap. I use Figma and Adobe XD for wireframing and create user friendly interfaces (UI Design). 
In process of learning Javascript frameworks starting with Vue.js adding Vuetify.
